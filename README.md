# Bullet-Hell-CptS487
Custom game engine built on Monogame engine demonstrated with the classic Bullet Hell game.

## Welcome to Bullet Hell!
A recreation of TouHou's classic shoot-em-up adventure. 

Built from scratch by Jackson Schuur in C# using Monogame and Microsoft Visual Studio 2017. Sprites supplemented by Sophia Schuur.

### How to play
You will need Monogame and MS Visual Studio to run the project file. If you do not have MS Visual Studio, you can download VS Code for free and install [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fernandoescolar.vscode-solution-explorer) extention. 
1. Clone the repo
2. Click "Take3.sln" to open the project file in MS Visual Studio 2017 (2015 probably works fine too)
3. Run the program
4. Play! Press the spacebar to shoot bullets and use ASDW to move.
5. Shoot the enemies dead while avoiding bullets to win! Keep an eye on your healthbar. Enemies and bosses will spawn after certain amounts of time. Some enemies rain down homing bullets so keep moving!

### Extra features
In the main menu, select GALLERY to view all animated sprites in a gallery. Updates automatically if new sprites are added later! No hard code here.

In the main menu, select OPTIONS to set the screen resolution, game speed, and keybindings. 

### Developer notes
All enemies, bullets, spawns, and the player can be directly customized with the JSON files without having to alter any source code.
